# Introduction

These examples and demos are for **TI SimpleLink CC2640R2 SDK 1.50.00.58**

This repository contains *Bluetooth&reg;* 4.2 Low Energy sample applications for
Texas Instruments' SimpleLink CC2640R2 SDK. These examples have not been
validated as production-ready.

**Do not** use GitHub's bug tracking feature for support. For inquiries, see the
[Bluetooth&reg; low energy Forum](https://e2e.ti.com/support/wireless_connectivity/bluetooth_low_energy/f/538).

To use the examples and tools in this repository, please download and install
the [SimpleLink CC2640R2 SDK](http://www.ti.com/ble-stack) **first**, and if
necessary [buy an evaluation kit](http://www.ti.com/tool/launchxl-cc2640r2).

For other hardware and software resources,
[please visit our wiki](http://www.ti.com/ble-wiki). If you have any questions
please refer to the [FAQ page](docs/faq.md).

For extra examples for **TI BLE-Stack 2.2.x SDK** (CC26x0R1), see
[Branch: ble_examples-2.2](https://github.com/ti-simplelink/ble_examples/tree/ble_examples-2.2).

# A Note about SimpleLink CC2640R2 SDK 1.50

The CC2640R2 SDK 1.50 is offered in two separate SDK installers, a Bluetooth
4.2 production certified installer (BLE-Stack), and a Bluetooth 5 (BLE5-Stack)
SDK installer permitting evaluation of the Bluetooth 5 Long Range (LE Coded PHY)
connections and Advertising Extension (AE) features. Both of these SDKs can be
obtained on the SDK portal page:
[CC2640R2 SDK download page](http://www.ti.com/tool/SIMPLELINK-CC2640R2-SDK).

Note: Access to production Bluetooth 5 2Mbps stack (BLE5-Stack 1.0.1) in SDK
1.40 can be found at the above SDK portal page as well with related GitHub
examples on the `simplelink_sdk-1.40` branch..

The Bluetooth 5 (BLE5-Stack 1.1.0) SDK for evaluating BLE5 Long Range features
is `simplelink_cc2640r2_sdk_1_50_00_71`, this SDK contains sample applications
for evaluating long range and is not supported by GitHub examples.

The production-certified Bluetooth 4.2 (BLE-Stack 3.1.1) component is included
in SDK installer version `simplelink_cc2640r2_sdk_1_50_00_58`.
This release is enabled with GitHub examples. Since this installer does not
support the BLE5-Stack component, the `ble5apps/` has been removed.

## Tools

### [Voice.py](tools/scripts/voice/voice.py)
This is script allows developers to evaluate the Voice over
HID-over-GATT-Profile (HoGP) profile which is demonstrated as part of the
`voice_hogp_remote` example. The `voie_hogp_remote` is available as part of the
[Simplelink CC2640R2 SDK BLE Example Pack](http://www.ti.com/tool/download/SIMPLELINK-CC2640R2-SDK-BLE-EXAMPLE-PACK).
The `voice.py` Python script is compatible with Python 2 or Python 3 and depends
on the Windows&reg; only [pywinusb](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pywinusb/) python
module. The script has been tested to work on a Window 10 host with a BLE 4.0
compatible BLE controller. For help on how to use the `voice.py` script, simply
invoke its help menu `voice.py --help`.
