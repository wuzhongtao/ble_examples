Purpose / Scope
===============

This sample project is used to add observer role to a BLE peripheral device to
show scanning functionality in a peripheral based project. The project is based
on simple_peripheral. This project is configured to run on the CC2640R2
Launchpad. 


Method
======

1. Compile and load the projects:
    - First build `simple_peripheral_observer_cc2640r2lp_stack_library`
    - Next build and load `simple_peripheral_observer_cc2640r2lp_app`

2. Connect to the LaunchPad via PuTTY (or other serial console emulator).

3. After connecting you will notice that the device is advertising, the terminal will display as below. (note that your BD_ADDR may be different)

        BLE Peripheral Observer
        0xB0B448D09105
        Advertising

4. You may initiate scanning at any time by pressing KEY\_LEFT (BTN-1), scanning may be canceled via KEY\_RIGHT (BTN-2). Scan reports are displayed on the terminal as

        Scanning Off
        Devices discovered: 14
        Advertising Addr: 0x4EFF5168AE58 Advertising Type: Connectable undirected
        Advertising Data: 02:01:1A:0A:FF:4C:00:10:05:01:90:74:DB:90:00:B6:E2:7D:A1:55:68:64:1D:2E:1E:B5:35:2D:34:20:


5. Additionaly the device can support a peripheral role connection while scanning, once connected to a peer, the terminal will show. Note your peer addr will be different
